### Fixed
- REI incompatibility when compat layer is running

## [0.2.2] - 2022-11-01

### Added
- config option to completely ignore items from unification and hiding

### Changed
- updated to JEI 10 as it's no longer alpha
  - minimum version is 10.2.1.278
  - JEI 9 is not supported anymore since it's not possible with some internals we use
- improved stone strata detection by making use of `forge:ores_in_ground` tag
  - this also allows pack devs to fix stone stratas for mods that don't support it yet

## [0.2.1] - 2022-10-28

### Added
- config backup system
  - when your config has invalid entries, it will be backed up and a new config will be generated
  - the new config will try to apply as many of the old settings as possible
  - new backups will overwrite old backups
- proper ingredient hiding for REI
  - hidden ingredients will no longer show up in recipes
  - this bumps the minimum REI version to 8.3.557

### Changed
- tag priority overrides now use `ResourceLocation`s internally to automatically validate config entries

## [0.2.0] - 2022-10-19

### Added
- priority overrides
  - allows to define a priority mod for a specific tag
  - the new option is automatically added to the `unify.json` config on the next run and is empty by default

## [0.1.0] - 2022-09-24

### WARNING
This release removes the modification of recipe IDs! If you modify any recipes which were unified already and make use of the recipe ID that uses `almostunified` as the namespace, make sure to fix it.

### Changed
- recipe modifications are now visible in JEI/REI by a little icon ([#8])
  - this was previously only visible via the recipe ID (now removed)
  - ensures that modified recipes which cause issues are not reported to the original authors
- recipe modifications now have less priority
  - allows to cover more mods that directly inject recipes into the recipe manager
  - still runs before the `recipes` event of KubeJS

### Removed
- recipe ID modifications ([#4], [#8])

### Fixed
- guide books showing errors because of modified recipe IDs ([#4], [#8])

## [0.0.9] - 2022-09-17

### Added
- `wires/{material}` tag to defaults
  - back up your `unify.json` config and let it regenerate to get the new defaults or add them yourself

- spaces in shaped recipe patterns not being handled correctly

## [0.0.8] - 2022-09-16

### Added
- more materials and `storage_blocks/raw_{material}` tag to defaults
  - back up your `unify.json` config and let it regenerate to get the new defaults or add them yourself
- `fabric:conditions` to default duplicate ignore list

### Changed
- ignore lists in `unify.json` and `duplicates.json` now support regular expressions
- default configs are now more platform specific

### Fixed
- a compat issue on Fabric when REI is present
- items being hidden when they are the only entry in a tag

## [0.0.7] - 2022-09-02

### Added
- more materials to defaults
  - back up your `unify.json` config and let it regenerate to get the new defaults or add them yourself

### Fixed
- stone strata detection for mods not following convention

## [0.0.6] - 2022-09-02

### Added
- `group` property to default ignored list
  - this ensures that crafting recipes with specific recipe book categories are correctly unified
  - back up your `duplicates.json` config and let it regenerate to get the new defaults or add them yourself
- `inputItems` and `outputItems` property to top level property scanning
  - allows unification for mods like `FTBIC`

### Fixed
- duplication matching for crafting recipes with a `group` property

## [0.0.5] - 2022-08-25

### Added
- Cucumber `shaped_tag` recipe type to default ignored types
  - if you are using Mystical Agriculture or other mods that require Cucumber, make the config change described [here][cucumber-shapedtag]

### Fixed
- shaped crafting recipe pattern matching ([#2])
  - previously shaped recipes were checked for exact equality after the unification
  - this caused issues with recipes using different definition keys for their patterns
  - this change requires a config adjustment described [here][pattern-matching]
